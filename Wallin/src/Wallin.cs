/*
 * GHOST (General meta-Heuristic Optimization Solving Tool) is a C# library 
 * designed to solve combinatorial satisfaction and optimization problems within 
 * some tenth of milliseconds. It has been originally designed to handle 
 * StarCraft: Brood War-related problems. 
 * 
 * GHOST is a framework aiming to easily model and implement satisfaction and optimization
 * problems. It contains a meta-heuristic solver aiming to solve any kind of these problems 
 * represented by a CSP/COP. It is a generalization of the C++ Wall-in project (https://github.com/richoux/Wall-in) 
 * and a C# adaptation and improvement of the GHOST's C++ version (https://github.com/richoux/GHOST).
 * Please visit https://github.com/richoux/GHOST_C_sharp for further information.
